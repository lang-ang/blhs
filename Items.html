                        According to the solution dialogue between Gynosus and Aegis in the 3 Goddesses Club Book,
                        because the spirit of Nyx was sealed in the base of the collective unconscious by life on Earth in antiquity,
                        Nyx existed in the spirit of all life on Earth - in other words, when life lost its hope of life or its fear of death, 
                        The unconscious resistance to the spirit of Nyx is weakened, and the individual manifestation is that the shadow has the upper hand. 
                        So the shadow is part of the spirit of Nyx, not one of Nyx's men or children.
                        In the Persona series, the shadow acts as the main monster and enemy in the work, and there are certain differences in the Settings of each version,
                        but in any case, once the shadow dies, the body dies immediately.

                    <td>
                        The persona is an alternate self in the mind of the manipulator, sometimes transformed from a shadow. 
                        Personas are all capable of more or less magic, as well as attacking through physical or magical means.
                        The persona evolves (reincarnates) with the spiritual growth of the manipulator, but there are special cases where the persona evolves by merging, 
                        such as Shunping and Chitori, while in P5R, the original and final persona can be separated into two individuals to merge and be born into a new persona.
                        No matter how many personas they hold, a person can only summon one at a time, cannot summon multiple personas, and can only switch between other personas.
                        (This rule does not apply to P3 protagonists)

                        Full Moon Operation is a series of major events in Persona 3 that takes place on the night of the full moon each month.
                        During the shadow hours of the night, usually one or two shadow apparitions appear. The protagonist will participate in each Full Moon action,
                        so there will be no other activities on that day. The Velvet Room is not accessible at this time, and to prevent softlock,
                        the game is not allowed to be saved during the Full Moon action. Operation Full Moon on January 31 locks the hero in Tartarus.
                        It is the main BOSS battle in the game. If there is a full moon on weekends or holidays, the protagonist cannot go out. After completing each full moon,
                        Tartarus will unlock new areas.

                        Arcana (アルカナ, Arcana[note 1], also translated as "Secret instrument") is a Tarot Card classification system and the central setting of the Persona series. 
                        Tarot was originally a popular card game, which was gradually used for fortune-telling. There are 78 Arcanas, divided into 22 Major Arcanas and 14 Minor Arcanas (swords, scepters, chalice and coins). 
                        The main use of the Persona series is 22 large Arcanas. Little Arcana only appears in Persona 2 Special Events and Persona 3 and Persona 4 Gold.
